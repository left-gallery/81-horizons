- In the original SVG there is `id` and `data-name` that can be removed to save a bit of gas.
- In the original SVG colors are defined in the `<style>` tag. By moving the colors in the `<rect />` itself we can save space and gas.
- Horizon 19 uses the SVG tag `<polygon />` instead of `<rect />` like all other artworks do. Is it on purpose?
- I recommend using `shape-rendering="crispEdges"` in the definition of the SVG to avoid issues on scaling (I have an example).
- Adding some bleeding to the right side may also fix some other rendering issues.

If my recommendations are implemented, we go from 283 bytes of the original SVG to 203 bytes.
